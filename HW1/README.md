# HW1

Please work in groups! 3-5 people is the best size to make sure you get help and work collaboratively, but everyone does something. Everyone of you needs to turn in their own notebook in their own  MLTSA_<Initial><Lastname> repository and each one of you needs to have a rendered README.md file (if you name it README.md it will automatically render!) that discusses youre contribution to the work of the group.
  
This issimilar to an acknowledgment of contribution you would find in a Nature letter see, for example these contributions. No penalties if you have just followed along, but statements from group members that are inconsistent will be penalized.
