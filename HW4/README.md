https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/blob/master/HW4/ClimateBSTS_instructions.ipynb

This honework will teach you skills in data integration and fusion and on the creation and interpretaation of additive models



### 1b: Probabilistic outlier detection with MCMC

https://github.com/fedhere/MLTSA_FBianco/blob/master/HW4/MCMCOutliers_instructions.ipynb

Few things are as usuful in data analysis as MCMC. It is really ubiquitous and extremely helpful in everything including time series analysis.  This homework will teach you to write down an likelihood and integrate it into the emcee and interpret the results. In addition it will show you how to create plots and write labels.
